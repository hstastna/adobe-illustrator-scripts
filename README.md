# Adobe Illustrator Scripts

A new, evolving set of ExtendScript scripts for simplifying work in Adobe Illustrator you don't find anywhere else!

## How to apply a script

You can install scripts first to have them listed as menu items in Illustrator, then to run them when you select them in the menu. For more check [how to install the script](https://ai-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/introduction/executingScripts/#installing-scripts-in-the-scripts-menu) in the Illustrator's Scripts menu.

For immediate executing the script, visit

**_File > Scripts > Other Scripts_**

in Illustrator, choose the downloaded script you want to run, and that's it!

It's also possible to run scripts on each launch of Illustrator (_startup stripts_).
